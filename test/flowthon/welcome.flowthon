def create_1000() -> numpy.ndarray:
    """
    Create 10000 values drawn for a normal distribution

    # Requirements
    - The output create_1000 is a NumPy array containing exactly 10000 numerical values.
    - The values in the array are of type float64.
    - The values in the array are drawn randomly from a normal (Gaussian) distribution, with the mean and standard deviation unspecified.
    - The array values are distributed as to represent a continuous variable distribution.

    # Algorithm
    - Import the numpy library.
    - Use the numpy function 'np.random.normal()' to generate 10,000 random float64 values.
    - Ensure the generated values are from a normal distribution with a mean and standard deviation of your choice.
    - Assign the resulting NumPy array to the variable 'create_1000'.
    - Return the variable 'create_1000'.

    # Assertions
    - The mean is about 3.
    - There are 1000 values.

def plot_purple(create_1000: np.ndarray) -> None:
    """
    Plot green histogram

    # Requirements
    - The function named 'plot_purple' accepts the numerical dataset provided by the 'create_1000' step.
    - The function generates a histogram visualization that depicts the frequency distribution of the dataset values.
    - The bars of the histogram are rendered in a green color.
    - The x-axis represents the value ranges of the dataset, while the y-axis denotes the frequencies.
    - The function does not return any value but renders the plot using matplotlib, hence it is displayed in the active figure's axis environment.

    # Algorithm
    - Import matplotlib.pyplot with plt as the alias for plotting.
    - Define a function named 'plot_purple', which takes one parameter named 'data'.
    - Inside the function body, call the 'plt.hist' function with the input data as the first argument and set the 'color' argument to 'green' to configure the histogram bar colors.
    - Add appropriate labels to the x-axis and y-axis using 'plt.xlabel' and 'plt.ylabel' to provide context to the histogram plot.
    - Call the 'plt.show()' function to render and open the visualization in the active Matplotlib environment.
    - End the function with no return statement as its purpose is only to display the plot.
